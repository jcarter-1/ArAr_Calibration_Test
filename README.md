# Decay Constant Comparison test using KCa data reported by Nuamenko-Dèzes et al. (2018)

Test of four decay constant calibrations with data presented by Nuamenko-Dèzes et al. (2018)
In this notebook we determine a combined K-Ca age and branching ratio for each calibration and then compare this to the Rb-Sr data for the sample as reported by the authors.
